Node.js bindings for [tmplr](https://github.com/loreanvictor/tmplr). These bindings are used by the default CLI to read values from the environment or modify the environment whenever Node.js is present. This decoupling allows running [tmplr](https://github.com/loreanvictor/tmplr) in other environments (such as on the browser, in distributed environments where the UI is located at a separate place than the backend, etc) by creating similar packages and UIs around it. For more information on this, checkout [@tmplr/core](https://github.com/loreanvictor/tmplr-core).
